This folder contains prototype versions of 3 codes

1) Linear Lifting Line Model that includes the 2D blown wing wind tunnel polars.
This is mostly implemented in run_LL and called by BLL_Main as the top-level
function.  BLL_Test-BLL_Test4 are various prototypes of this. 

2)Non-linear lifting line model that uses the same polars but instead of a 
solution via a Fourier sine series it uses substitution to iteratively converge
on the result.  This is run via NLL_Test and run_NLL, respectively. 
These two give roughly similar answers; there are still some numerical issues
with the NLL code but development stopped to work on..

3) Weissenger Vortex Lattice implementation of the same problem.  Currently 
in wvl_test.m, validated against simple AVL test cases w/o blowing.
